## How to write a Layoff Letter

It is the season of layoffs letters from the CEOs. Every week a few new ones come out is one so there is no shortage of examples. However, I haven’t found information that is neatly packaged for those who are tasked by their bosses to ghost write one. 

This is a quick guide to help those who don't have any idea to start. It will address you, the writer, but to be effective you must put yourself in the shoes of the CEO, so sometimes the royal you will be the CEO you. Sometimes it will be the corporation you, since corporations are people too. 
As you get a draft that is ready, make sure you have thought through the following five parts of advice to equip you to write the best CEO Layoff letter possible.

### Understand your Audience:

By now, it should be obvious who your audience is. Clear letters have the audience clearly in mind. Your writing should be tailored to address their concerns and be in language that builds your relationship between you, the company, and them when they read it.
*	Do: keep the message for your audience top of mind. This letter indicates a major disruption to people’s lives. Prioritize the message for the ones you care about the most at these turbulent times: your current and potential investors
*	Do Not: address them in this letter explicitly. These people love finding ways to make things about themselves. They love to watch movies and see themselves as the rebel alliance. They, however, shy away when their names are explicitly called out
*	Do Not: try to write a letter to everyone. A message for everyone is a message for no one. Remember to cut through the noise. People who don’t work for the company are noise. That includes people who won’t be working for the company by the time they read the letter.
*	Do Not: address your letter with ‘Employees’
*	Do: address your letter with a friendlier choice. ‘Colleagues’ or ‘teammates’ are good. ‘Family’ or ‘Friends’ is a bit too much. Ideally, you, like many other companies, spend a responsible amount of money to create an employee nickname. Use it

### Take Responsibility:

Some say this is one of most the difficult parts of the process. It is why I called out that you should tell people how hard it is in the next part. Keep it concise to make this part easier.
*	Do: explicit callout that you take responsibility and accountability. Times like this call for clarity. Full Stop. Like, actually do not go any further. You’ve called out that you take responsibility, you don’t need to go further on what that means.
*	Do: mention that it was difficult but the right decision to make. Again, know when to stop. Saying that it is the right decision creates confidence. Addressing whom it a right decision for does not.
*	Do: state that it is necessary. Again, there is a fine line to talk about the need to manage expenses. But do not talk about it doesn’t matter whether you might be profitable, because people don’t want the letter to mention that you need to have even higher profit margin. Trust the investors know what you mean.
Provide Context:
This is where you get to shine! This is the meaty part of the letter. It can get very complicated quickly, so revising and reviewing this part is important
*	Do: use a good heading like “What has changed”, “Why are we making this decision”, or “How did we get here”. Good heading create structure, unlike losing a 9-5 job.
*	Do: remind people that you had confidence and believed in your long-term trends prediction and that led to the wrong decisions related to hiring. Oops, you thought you were making the right decisions that set you up well for the future
*	Do: remind people that you have confidence and believe in your long-term trends predictions and that is leading you to this right decision related to hiring (or ,more appropriately, firing)
*	Do: call out how you are confident about the slow down demand and gloomy future of the company and industry
*	Do: call out how you are confident about the growth and the bright future of the company and industry. This decision should set you up well, and this time you are right!
*	Do: share that it is the decisions and innovation that drive your competitive advantage compared to your peer companies
*	Do: share that it is the decisions industry wide that drives this decision making process. Others also hired. Others are also laying off so it makes sense to as well.
* Do: talk about where reality is. We often tell our employees to dream big. But people make mistakes when they dream sometimes. They need to take responsibility.
*	Do: keep it short. Your letter should be shorter than this guide. Ideally, less than one page. Fewer things for people to critique. Less is more

### Severance Package and Resources:

Good work. You got through the hardest part. This should be the easiest part to write and you don’t need to think about content. Ask your HR/ Finance team for details and copy and paste.
*	Do: offer at least 14 weeks of paid severance. Don’t be a dick
*	Do: offer a later termination date if you are based in the US. Don’t be a dick to immigrants
*	Do: offer health coverage if you are based in the US. Don’t be a dick.

### Sign off:
Thank you for making it this far. See how powerful saying thanks is? Don’t forget to thank your employees for their contribution
* Do: thank the people you are planning to layoff. This will help them feel seen. Mention something along the lines that you couldn't have built this company without them
* Do: thank the people who will be working tomorrow. Mention something along the lines that you understand that there will be a period of morning, but you trust that the company will be built better and with greater focus.
*	Do: remember what was said at the beginning. Remember who you are writing for
*	Do: check if you have got all your legal reviews done for this letter. Your legal team has failed you if they haven’t been proactive about leaving a disclaimer. (Another source of ammunition to reduce headcount!) By this point, you have successfully constructed so many forward looking statements that readers should have forgotten to look back and think about what responsibility should look like. With every solution comes more problems. To solve this next one you should include, in italics and in smaller font, a disclaimer that forward-looking statements don’t mean anything.
